about_content: |
  Hello, I am a full-stack software engineer and there are my professional guidelines:
  - Write Software that can be easily maintained.  
  - Build products that can evolve on the long run.  
  - Never solve the same problem twice.  
  - The end user experience is, if not the only, the nÂ°1 focus.

  I achieve this by:
  - Automating everything that can be using CI/CD and containerization.
  - Caring a great deal about software architecture. Writing code decoupled, implementing Clean Archi.
  - Rigorous implementation of strict typing and testing.
  - Solving problems in isolation, writing documentation for my future self and the community and opensourcing.

  I choose to focus on the JavaScript ecosystem because it's the only language that run's everywhere 
  and I believe there are great benefits in using the same stack for backend frontend and scripting.

  - I am dyslexic, my spelling is terrible but [Antidote](https://www.antidote.info/fr) does wonders.

  #### Programming paradigm
  I favor functional over object oriented and I can write an essay explaining why
  but I happily work on OOP codebase when required to. 

  #### JS Runtimes 
  I know well all major JavaScript runtime: 
  Node.js, Browsers, ReactNative, LiquidCore, Deno  

  #### Front-end frameworks
  I can build my own UI framework from scratch but I use React (or whatever is in place) because the wheel does not need to be reinvented.  

  #### System security and Cryptography
  I know how to implement symmetrical and asymmetrical encryption.  
  Writing secure code is a major interest for me, I know and understand most of the common
  vulnerabilities in IT systems.

  #### System administration
  I prefer working using k8s and docker but I know UNIX system enough
  to deploy services without containerization. I am good at scripting.  
  I have have a lot of experience with AWS.

  #### Language Theory
  I can write compilers and interpreters.

  #### Databases
  I know how to design and query complex relational databases.  
  If given the choice, I use MySQL.

  #### Devops
  I know how to implement CD/CI. I know GitHub Actions features well.

  #### Network engineering
  Deep understanding of the TCP/IP stack and of how the web works in general.  
  I can implements complex network protocol from RFC specs.

  #### Languages with which I have a real expertise (try me)
  JavaScript, TypeScript

  #### Language with which I can be efficient on day one
  Java, C

  #### Languages with which I have some experience but I would need a couple of week to get fully efficient with
  C#, Python, C++, ADA, R, Matlab
